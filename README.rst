drf-chunked-upload
==================

This simple django app enables users to upload large files to Django
Rest Framework in multiple chunks, with the ability to resume if the
upload is interrupted.

This app is based to a large degree on the work of `Julio
Malegria <https://github.com/juliomalegria>`__, specifically his
`django-chunked-upload
app <https://github.com/juliomalegria/django-chunked-upload>`__.

License: `MIT-Zero <https://romanrm.net/mit-zero>`__.

Installation
------------

Install via pip:

::

    pip install drf-chunked-upload

And then add it to your Django ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'drf_chunked_upload',
    )

Typical usage
-------------

1. An initial PUT request is sent to the url linked to
   ``ChunkedUploadView`` (or any subclass) with the first chunk of the
   file. The name of the chunk file can be overriden in the view (class
   attribute ``field_name``). Example:

.. code:: python

    r = requests.put(upload_url, headers={
                "Content-Range": "bytes {}-{}/{}".format(index, index + size - 1, total),
            }, data={"filename": build_file}, files={'file': chunk_data})

2. In return, the server will respond with the ``url`` of the upload,
   and the current ``offset``. Example:

::

    {
        'id': 'f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd'
        'url': 'https://your-host/<path_to_view>/f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd',
        'file': 'https://your-host/<path_to_file>/f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd.part',
        'filename': 'example.bin',
        'offset': 10000,
        `created_at`: '2021-05-18T17:12:50.318718Z',
        'status': 1,
        'completed_at': None,
        'user': 1
    }


3. Repeatedly PUT subsequent chunks to the ``url`` returned from the
   server. Example:

.. code:: python

    # PUT to https://your-host/<path_to_view>/f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd
    upload_url = "https://your-host/<path_to_view>/f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd"
    r = requests.put(upload_url, headers={
                "Content-Range": "bytes {}-{}/{}".format(index, index + size - 1, total),
            }, data={"filename": build_file}, files={'file': chunk_data})

4. Server will continue responding with the ``url`` and current ``offset``.

5. Finally, when upload is completed, POST a request to the returned
   ``url``. This request must include the checksum (hex) of the entire file.
   Example:

.. code:: python

    # POST to https://your-host/<path_to_view>/5230ec1f59d1485d9d7974b853802e31
    upload_url = "https://your-host/<path_to_view>/f64ebd67-83a3-45b6-8acd-c749ea1ed4cd"
    r = requests.put(upload_url, data={"md5": "fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677"})

6. If everything is OK, server will response with status code 200 and
   the data returned in the method ``get_response_data`` (if any).

7. If you want to upload a file as a single chunk, this is also
   possible! Simply make the first request a POST and include the checksum
   digest for the file. You don't need to include the ``Content-Range`` header
   if uploading a whole file.

**Possible error responses:**

-  Upload has expired. Server responds 410 (Gone).
-  ``id`` does not match any upload. Server responds 404 (Not found).
-  No chunk file is found in the indicated key. Server responds 400 (Bad
   request).
-  Request does not contain ``Content-Range`` header. Server responds
   400 (Bad request).
-  Size of file exceeds limit (if specified). Server responds 400 (Bad
   request).
-  Offsets do not match. Server responds 400 (Bad request).
-  Checksums do not match. Server responds 400 (Bad request).

Settings
--------

Add any of these variables into your project settings to override them.

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_EXPIRATION_DELTA``

-  How long after creation the upload will expire.
-  Default: ``datetime.timedelta(days=1)``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_PATH``

-  Path where uploaded files will be stored.
-  Default: ``'chunked_uploads/%Y/%m/%d'``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_CHECKSUM``

- The type of checksum to use when verifying checksums. Options include anything
  supported by Python's hashlib (md5, sha1, sha256, etc)
- Default: ``'md5'``


``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_COMPLETE_EXT``

-  Extension to use for completed uploads. Uploads will be renamed using
   this extension on completion, unless this extension matched
   DRF\_CHUNKED\_UPLOAD\_INCOMPLETE\_EXT.
-  Default: ``'.done'``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_INCOMPLETE_EXT``

-  Extension for in progress upload files.
-  Default: ``'.part'``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_STORAGE_CLASS``

-  Storage system (should be a class)
-  Default: ``None`` (use default storage system)

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_USER_RESTRICED``

-  Boolean that determines whether only the user who created an upload
   can view/continue an upload.
-  Default: ``True``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_ABSTRACT_MODEL``

-  Boolean that defines if the ``ChunkedUpload`` model will be abstract
   or not (`what does abstract model
   mean? <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/models/options/#abstract>`__).
-  Default: ``True``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES``

-  Max amount of data (in bytes) that can be uploaded. ``None`` means no
   limit.
-  Default: ``None``

``DRF_CHUNKED_UPLOAD_REVERSE_URL_NAME``

-  Reverse URL to redirect to after uploading the initial chunk
-  Default: ``'chunkedupload-detail'``
